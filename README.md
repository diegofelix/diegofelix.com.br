# Personal Website

This is my personal website, built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com).

As a long-time PHP backend developer, Iâ€™m not very experienced with frontend development. I followed a [Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dImgZ_AH7uA) to learn more about Next.js, React, and Tailwind, and made some customizations along the way to personalize my site.

I plan to continue updating the site as I learn more about Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS.
